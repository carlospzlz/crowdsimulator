In memory of my grandpa:\\

My grandpa used to wear a blue jacket. I have not ever asked where he bought it, but I assume he took it in the  cloth shop he built from scratch, and called with his wife's name.

My grandpa used to give hidden tip to the bartender to get extra olives for his grandchildren, while he pretended to look at his wine.

Lately, my grandpa used to forget things, that is why my grandma received birthday's cakes several times a year (none of them in the right date).

My grandpa was sometimes very grumpy, but his smile warmed more than the Sun.

My grandpa always gave me the money for the bus when I left on Sundays, even when I left to other country with an Erasmus scholarship.

My grandpa agreed to my mother that buying me a car could be dangerous, but he gave me driving lessons on Fridays' afternoon.

When I was younger, I was always crying because I did not want to attend to a piano lesson with a very tough teacher, but suddenly one day she was lovely; later I discovered she had met my grandpa.

My grandpa used to build kites with old papers from the cloth shop, pasting them to wooden sticks with hot potato. One day he put a kite higher than the clouds. Other day he arose from a sea of spiny plants with a lost kite on his hand shouting: "I won't fly it again!". But he did.

My grandpa once caught a falcon.

When I was young, my grandpa told me that some turtles used to stay very quiet for a long time. After discovering that my turtle died, I knew that my grandpa had gone hidden to the pet shop to try to buy another one, but they did not have more.

When I got older, my grandpa always reminded me to carry socks to excursions; not the ones which come in pairs, but the ones which come in boxes of six or twelve.

Every night my grandpa gave me a cup of chamomile. Once, I threw it with my elbow and he shouted at me, and I ran to my bed crying. I do not remember how much time later, but it was exactly the time chamomile requires to be done, because there he was, waking me up, grabbing a cup with both hands.

Girls called me many things, even tons of them did not ever call me at all. But once, one said to me that I was authentic. My grandpa was authentic, genuine. He was a real person, a real human being.

My grandpa taught me the value of a good heart, a sharp mind and big nuts.
