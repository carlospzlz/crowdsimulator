% MSc. CAVE latex template
%
% This is a modification of my thesis template, so there may be some things you want to remove.
% Each chapter is in a separate latex file. Those files are included using \input
% You can keep everything in one file by replacing the line "\input{...}" by the content of your chapter 
% Separate files are made so that you can compile chapters independently. Latex can be long to compile large documents
% if your thesis is not too long, then you should probably keep everything in one file.

% I use a lot of margin and padding. Feel free to change it in format-setup. If you have additional package, you can add them in format-setup.
% You can change practically everything in latex, just google it, there are always plenty of answers.
